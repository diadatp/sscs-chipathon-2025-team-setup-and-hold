# Schematic Review
We plan to do an AOI222 standard cell in X1 drive strength for the OSU library. We plan to do at least a 12t version 
and perhaps a 9t version if we get the time.

The schematic can be found under [globalfoundries-pdk-libs-gf180mcu_sah_sc/cells/aoi222](globalfoundries-pdk-libs-gf180mcu_sah_sc/cells/aoi222).
